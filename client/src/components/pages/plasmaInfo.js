        <h1>What is Blood?</h1>
        Blood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells—such as nutrients 
        and oxygen—and transports waste products away from those same cells. It is composed of blood cells suspended in a liquid called plasma. 
        Blood plays a critical role in the body's defense against infection and disease. Blood cells are of mainly three types RBC,WBC & platelets.
        <h1>Importance of Donation</h1>
        Donating plasma can save lives. Your antibodies can help someone fight the infection and emerge victoriously. If your COVID
        symptoms have been absent for more than 14 days, kindly consider donating as a service to humanity. Just like during any 
        regular blood donation session, blood will be drawn from your arm. It will be sent through special tubes that will separate the
        plasma from the blood.
        <h1>You CAN donate plasma if:-</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You were tested positive for COVID-19.</li>
            <li>You are between 18-60 years old.</li>
            <li>You have fully recovered.</li>
            <li>You are free of symptoms for 14 days.</li>
            <li>You have tested positive before 28 days.</li>
            <li>In case you have already donated plasma, you are still eligible to donate again after every 14 days or as recommended
                by your doctor.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>You CANNOT donate plasma if:-</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Your weight is less than 50 kg.</li>
            <li>You have ever been pregnant.</li>
            <li>You are diabetic on insulin.</li>
            <li>Your Blood Pressure is more than 140 and diastolic less than 60 or more than 90.</li>
            <li>You have uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension with change in medication in last 28 days.</li>
            <li>You are a Cancer Survivor.</li>
            <li>You have chronic kidney/heart/lung or liver disease.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Things to remember before you donate plasma:-</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not drink alcohol for at least 24 hours before you donate blood. Alcohol remains in your system for about a day
                and so could end up in the blood that is collected from you. Besides alcohol acts as a blood thinner, so there
                could be a lot of bleeding when you are hooked to the blood extraction device.
            </li>
            <li>Do not smoke or consume heavy meals/greasy foods before plasma donation.</li>
            <li>Do not pop an aspirin or any kind of pain-relieving medication for 48 hours before the donation. These medicines 
                affect your blood’s platelets.
            </li>
        </ul>
      </>
